🚨 CRITICAL EMOJI MAPPING ANALYSIS RESULTS

Based on testing the exact endpoints with question: "What are fire safety requirements?"

FINDINGS:
1. POST /api/chat/ask - Uses 🧠 **Mentoring Insight** (WRONG!)
2. POST /api/chat/ask-enhanced - Uses 🧠 **Mentoring Insight** (WRONG!)
3. POST /api/chat/boost-response - Daily limit reached (cannot test)

CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED:
- Both regular and enhanced chat endpoints use 🧠 (brain) emoji for Mentoring Insight
- This should be 💡 (light bulb) emoji instead
- User complaint is VALID: "Mentoring insight emoji should NOT be a brain!"

CORRECT EMOJI MAPPING SHOULD BE:
✅ 🔧 **Technical Answer** (currently correct)
❌ 🧠 **Mentoring Insight** (WRONG - should be 💡)
✅ 📋 **Next Steps** (currently correct)
✅ 📊 **Code Requirements** (currently correct in enhanced)
✅ ✅ **Compliance Verification** (currently correct in enhanced)
✅ 🔄 **Alternative Solutions** (currently correct in enhanced)
✅ 🏛️ **Authority Requirements** (currently correct in enhanced)
✅ 📄 **Documentation Needed** (currently correct in enhanced)
✅ ⚙️ **Workflow Recommendations** (currently correct in enhanced)
✅ ❓ **Clarifying Questions** (currently correct in enhanced)

BACKEND RESPONSE ANALYSIS:

1. Regular Chat Response (/api/chat/ask):
   - Contains: "🔧 **Technical Answer:**" ✅
   - Contains: "🧠 **Mentoring Insight:**" ❌ (should be 💡)
   - Contains: "📋 **Next Steps:**" ✅
   - Response length: ~1089 tokens
   - Format: Dual-layer (technical + mentoring)

2. Enhanced Chat Response (/api/chat/ask-enhanced):
   - Contains: "🔧 **Technical Answer**" ✅
   - Contains: "🧠 **Mentoring Insight**" ❌ (should be 💡)
   - Contains: "📋 **Next Steps**" ✅
   - Contains: "📊 **Code Requirements**" ✅
   - Contains: "✅ **Compliance Verification**" ✅
   - Contains: "🔄 **Alternative Solutions**" ✅
   - Contains: "🏛️ **Authority Requirements**" ✅
   - Contains: "📄 **Documentation Needed**" ✅
   - Contains: "⚙️ **Workflow Recommendations**" ✅
   - Contains: "❓ **Clarifying Questions**" ✅
   - Response length: ~1010 tokens
   - Format: Enhanced dual-layer with full emoji mapping

ROOT CAUSE:
The AI service is configured to use 🧠 (brain) emoji for Mentoring Insight sections
instead of the correct 💡 (light bulb) emoji.

IMPACT:
- Users see "ridiculous placement of emojis" 
- "Mentoring insight emoji should NOT be a brain!"
- "some are not of the set we agreed upon"
- "presentation of the response is amateurish"

SOLUTION REQUIRED:
Update the AI service emoji mapping to replace 🧠 with 💡 for Mentoring Insight sections.
