The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has significantly evolved the ONESource AI application. Initially, critical UI/UX bugs were addressed, including fixing missing buttons and refining error message placements. A major focus was enhancing the chat interface for professional AI response formatting, incorporating specific emoji mappings, and addressing issues where AI responses were not displayed or formatted correctly. This involved extensive debugging across  and  on the frontend, and  and  on the backend, particularly around inconsistent system prompts and mock response handling.

Subsequently, the engineer undertook a comprehensive branding update, replacing logos, implementing a new color palette via Tailwind, and ensuring correct linking. Help Center functionality received attention, with FAQ rewrites for standards coverage and a significant fix for the search bar, which was resolved by addressing an overlapping UI element (). This also involved improving markdown rendering, assistant icons, and button contrast.

A major feature addition was the implementation of a Phase 1 Global Business Identifier system for partner registration. This involved creating new React components (, ), updating  and  on the frontend, and modifying  and  on the backend to support multi-country, format-only validation, and a manual review workflow.

The most recent work focused on the pricing page, adding the ONESource-ai icon, fixing spinning purchase buttons (due to package ID mismatches and lack of error handling for Stripe API calls), updating pricing values, and enhancing the visual prominence of the Pro-Plus plan. While most issues were resolved, the Enhanced Emoji Mapping Consistency for the regular chat endpoint remained a persistent, unresolved bug, where  and  emojis were still missing from technical and mentoring insights despite multiple attempts to align backend prompts and frontend rendering.

<product_requirements>
The ONESource AI application aims to be an AI mentor and single point of truth for the AU/NZ construction industry. Key functionalities include Firebase authentication, Stripe payments, and OpenAI integration within a branded UI. Previous efforts focused on backend stability, UI/UX (e.g., ChatGPT-like AI formatting), and deployment. Core features include a Knowledge Vault (evolving into Community and Personal knowledge banks, requiring partner self-registration and content policies), and user personalization via comprehensive profiles and onboarding. The user's primary focus is resolving critical navigation, functionality bugs, and UI issues from beta testing (V1, V2, V3), enhancing user feedback, and refining UI elements like logo placement and dynamic content to achieve a polished, professional, and intelligently responsive AI platform. Recent requirements include expanding partner registration globally with a Global Business Identifier (GBI) selector and validator (initially for English-speaking countries with format-only validation) and enhancing the pricing page's branding, functionality, and prominence of specific plans.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the pricing page's visual prominence based on user feedback from Beta Testing V4. The specific request was to make the Pro-Plus plan the MOST POPULAR and visually distinct.

The engineer's last actions involved:
1.  Modifying  to adjust the visual styling of the pricing cards.
2.  Specifically, the Pro-Plus plan was given a  transformation, an  class, a MOST POPULAR badge in  blue, and a border in  (Botticelli) color.
3.  The previous prominence (border) was removed from the Pro plan.
4.  The button styling for the Pro-Plus plan was also enhanced to align with its prominent status.
5.  Restarting the frontend service to apply these CSS changes.
6.  Taking a final screenshot of the  page to verify the visual changes.

The user's last feedback after this work was ok that looks good, indicating satisfaction with the pricing page's visual prominence update.
