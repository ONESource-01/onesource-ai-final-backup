The AI engineer's work on the ONESource AI application began with resolving backend syntax issues and integrating a weekly reporting service. Significant UI/UX improvements followed, including a multi-variant hero section and new static pages. A private staging environment workaround, complete with role-based access control, was implemented, along with critical API key configurations for OpenAI and Stripe. A major focus was later placed on a two-tier Knowledge Bank system (Community for partners, Personal for users) requiring extensive backend and frontend modifications, including partner registration with ABN validation. A substantial portion of the work involved persistent GitHub push issues related to secret exposure in git history, which was resolved through multiple WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an

<product_requirements>
The ONESource AI application serves the AU/NZ construction industry as an AI mentor, aiming to be a single point of truth for industry intelligence. Initial features included Firebase authentication, Stripe payments, OpenAI integration, user management, and a branded UI.

Recent enhancements and requirements have focused on:
1.  **Backend Stability:** Resolving syntax errors and integrating a weekly business intelligence reporting system (initially using SendGrid, later modified for graceful fallback).
2.  **UI/UX Improvement:** Redesigning the landing page hero section, creating new legal/contact/feedback pages, and generally professionalizing the frontend with ChatGPT-like formatting for AI responses.
3.  **Deployment & Environment:** Setting up a private staging environment with beta access controls and addressing API key management (OpenAI, Stripe). Resolving a legacy Firebase domain conflict.
4.  **Knowledge Management Evolution:** Implementing a sophisticated Knowledge Vault (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. This evolved into a Community Knowledge Bank for verified partners (with ABN, for shared, attributable content) and a Personal Knowledge Bank for individual users (private content for their chat sessions). This required partner self-registration and clear content review policies.
5.  **Core Feature Enhancements:** Adding a Booster feature for users to preview higher-tier AI responses, fixing broken conversation history, search, and Add Knowledge input.
6.  **User Personalization & Onboarding:** Implementing a comprehensive user profile, a multi-step onboarding flow with multi-select industry/profession options, and visual indicators for AI personalization.

<pending_tasks>
-   Finalize legal document details (confirm real business address).
-   Gather required API keys for SendGrid (deferred, currently handled gracefully).
-   Refine the content review process for individual user uploads to the Personal Knowledge Bank.
-   Implement the Smart Auto-Complete System for the onboarding flow's industry/discipline selection, proposed by the AI engineer.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user feedback point regarding the onboarding experience for new users. The user uploaded a beta testing markup detailing a large list of 17 industry sectors and 40 industry disciplines, highlighting the challenge of presenting these options clearly and allowing multi-selection during onboarding. The user specifically asked how to cleverly show these all and suggested a type-ahead auto-fill mechanism.

The AI engineer successfully read and interpreted the provided PDF markup, confirming a clear understanding of the comprehensive industry coverage and the user's specific pain point regarding the large selection list. The engineer then proposed a detailed Smart Auto-Complete System as a solution. This proposed system includes:
1.  **Type-ahead Search**: Users can start typing to filter suggestions.
2.  **Tag-based Selection**: Selected items appear as removable badges.
3.  **Mobile-friendly Interface**: Ensuring usability across devices.
4.  **Smart Categorization**: Grouping by Industry Sectors vs. Disciplines for better organization.
5.  **Progressive Addition**: Allowing multiple selections without losing previous choices.

This discussion occurred after extensive fixes to critical bugs (runtime errors, UI layout, booster limits, input fields, search functionality), a major overhaul to the Knowledge Bank system (two-tier Community/Personal, partner registration with ABN validation), and the implementation of a comprehensive user profile and multi-step onboarding flow. The proposed auto-complete system is the next logical step to complete the refined onboarding experience based on user's direct feedback.
