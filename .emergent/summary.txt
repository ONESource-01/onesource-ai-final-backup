The AI engineer's work on the ONESource AI application has progressed through several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on resolving backend syntax errors related to a new weekly business intelligence reporting system. This involved debugging  and , installing , and integrating the reporting service into the FastAPI backend.

Subsequently, major UI/UX enhancements were implemented for the landing page's hero section. This involved creating  to display multiple hero variants, integrating them into , handling image backgrounds and overlays, and refining content based on user feedback. The engineer also created new , , and  components, ensuring consistent branding and email contact () across all relevant pages using a shared .

A significant phase involved setting up a private staging environment workaround due to platform limitations, which included implementing a  and role-based access control using  and . This phase also addressed crucial API key configurations for OpenAI (quota issues, billing) and Stripe (switching between live and test keys, emphasizing live transaction implications).

Finally, the engineer provided extensive guidance on deployment, ongoing maintenance, and a detailed testing feedback protocol, including the ability to interpret annotated screenshots. The most recent task involved troubleshooting and identifying a legacy Firebase hosting deployment () that was conflicting with the main domain, providing precise steps for its removal.

The ONESource AI Application is an AI mentor tailored for the AU/NZ construction industry, designed for a production-ready, professional user experience. Key initial functionalities included Firebase authentication, Stripe payments, OpenAI integration, and user management, all presented via a branded landing page, authentication UI, chat, onboarding, and pricing.

The application has been significantly enhanced with:
1.  **Branding**: Custom color palette, ONESource-ai logo, and a construction hero banner.
2.  **Chat Interface**: Redesigned to a ChatGPT-style layout with a sidebar, history, and interactive message actions (copy, feedback, Add Knowledge).
3.  **Authentication & Trials**: Integrated real Firebase authentication with a 3 questions per day trial limit.
4.  **Backend Services**: New APIs and MongoDB collections for chat feedback, user knowledge contributions, persistent chat history, and an admin dashboard for content review.
5.  **Knowledge Management (RAG)**: Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (knowledgeVault) for intelligent document processing (PDF, Word, DWG, Excel) with supplier attribution.
6.  **Developer Access**: A system to grant unlimited consultant-level access.
7.  **Voucher System**: For time-limited access and promotional campaigns.
8.  **3-Phase AI Intelligence**: Enhanced Prompting, Workflow Intelligence, and Specialized Training for discipline-specific, context-aware construction AI.
9.  **Legal Framework**: Comprehensive Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Partner Upload Policy, including Standards Australia copyright compliance.
10. **Revised Pricing Structure**: Tiered plans (Starter, Pro, Pro-Plus, Day Pass) with strategic feature distribution and a 3-month free trial.

Recent requirements included a weekly business intelligence reporting system, hero banner improvements, setting up a testing environment, and configuring API keys for deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively assisting the user in resolving a critical domain conflict. The user reported that their primary domain, , was unexpectedly redirecting to a legacy Firebase hosted page, preventing them from using it for a new marketing website.

The engineer methodically diagnosed the issue by guiding the user to inspect their Firebase Console. Through this collaborative debugging, it was determined that a *separate*, older Firebase hosting deployment was configured for  within the  site of their Firebase project. This legacy configuration was intercepting traffic to the main domain.

The work concluded with the engineer pinpointing the exact location ( site within the Firebase project, specifically under Domains) where the  custom domain was connected. The last action was to provide the user with clear, step-by-step instructions to click on the problematic domain ( in the Firebase console) and then select the option to Remove domain or Delete it, to free up the domain for its intended use.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is for the user to confirm the removal of the  custom domain from the specified Firebase project.
