#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The ABNs '12 345 678 901' and '83 147 290 275' are mathematically INVALID according to the official ATO algorithm (weighted sum mod 89 ≠ 0). Valid ABNs like '51 824 753 556' and '33 102 417 032' pass validation correctly. The algorithm properly: 1) Cleans input (removes spaces/hyphens), 2) Validates 11-digit length, 3) Subtracts 1 from first digit, 4) Applies official ATO weights [10,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19], 5) Calculates weighted sum, 6) Checks divisibility by 89. Partner registration system working correctly - it properly rejects invalid ABNs and accepts valid ones. The system is functioning as designed per ATO specifications."

    message: "🎯 ABN VALIDATION INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - SYSTEM WORKING CORRECTLY: After comprehensive testing and debugging, the ABN validation algorithm is implementing the official ATO checksum algorithm correctly. The ABNs '12 345 678 901' and '83 147 290 275' are mathematically INVALID according to the official ATO specification (weighted sum mod 89 ≠ 0). The system correctly accepts valid ABNs like '51 824 753 556' and '33 102 417 032' which pass the ATO checksum test. ✅ RESOLUTION: Partner Registration System is functioning correctly per ATO specifications. The algorithm properly validates ABN format, applies official ATO weights [10,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19], calculates weighted sums, and checks divisibility by 89. All partner registration features now confirmed working: ABN validation (per ATO spec), terms agreement enforcement, duplicate detection, authentication requirements, and partner status checking. 🏆 FINAL STATUS: All 5 major backend systems fully operational - Partner Registration, Two-Tier Knowledge Bank, Enhanced Search, Enhanced Chat, and Admin Management."

The backend is generating substantial, high-quality content (1,574-2,441 characters) with correct Australian standards references (AS 1851, AS 4072, AS 2118, AS 1530, BCA, NCC). ✅ RESPONSE FORMAT: Proper dual-layer technical + mentoring structure with correct JSON formatting. ✅ KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION: Enhanced chat successfully using knowledge banks with 2 sources integrated. ✅ AUTHENTICATION & TOKENS: Mock auth working with proper trial tracking and token usage monitoring (805-811 tokens). 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Since backend returns perfect responses but users see error messages, the issue is FRONTEND-RELATED. The problem is likely in the React app's response parsing, error display logic, or authentication token handling. The backend chat system is fully operational and ready for production. RECOMMENDATION: Focus debugging efforts on the frontend React components that handle chat responses and error display."
