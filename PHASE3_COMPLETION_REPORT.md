- ✅ `dismiss_examples` - When user dismisses example panel

**Metrics Dashboard:**
```json
{
  "examples_served_total": 35,
  "example_clicks_total": 2, 
  "suggested_action_clicks_total": 2,
  "overall_example_ctr_percent": 5.71,
  "example_ctr_by_topic": {
    "fire": {"served": 3, "clicked": 2, "ctr_percent": 66.7},
    "plumbing": {"served": 2, "clicked": 0, "ctr_percent": 0.0}
